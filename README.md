# 42_Swifty_Companion
Swifty Companion is part of the 42 advanced curriculum and designed to explore the fundamentals of app development. As I had dabbled in iOS development before, I decided to build the project as a native iOS app using Swift. The app integrates with the 42 API to provide detailed information about any 42 student, including their profile and skills.
